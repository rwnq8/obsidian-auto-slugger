Automatically or manually create clean, descriptive slugs for your Obsidian notes (e.g., `104538-auto-slugger-plugin`). Great for permalinks, better organization, and web publishing!

## üåü What It Does

*   **Creates Slugs:** Generates a unique identifier for your notes.
*   **Timestamped:** Starts with a 6-digit (HHMMSS) or 12-digit (YYMMDDHHMMSS) timestamp.
*   **Smart Words:** Adds 1-5 important words from your note's content.
*   **Automatic or Manual:**
    *   **Auto:** Makes slugs when you change, save, or click away from a note (you choose).
    *   **Manual:** Make a slug anytime with a button or command.
*   **Customizable:** You control where the slug is stored (frontmatter key), if it overwrites old slugs, and more!
