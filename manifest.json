```*(If your `authorUrl` or `author` in `manifest.json` should be different, please let me know, but `rwnq8` is consistent with the repo name).*

**Next Steps (Again, apologies for making this take longer than it should):**

1.  **Update `package.json` on GitHub:**
    *   Go to your `package.json` file in the `rwnq8/obsidian-auto-slugger` repository.
    *   Click "Edit".
    *   Replace its entire content with the first code block above.
    *   Commit this change directly to your `main` (or default) branch.

2.  **Update `manifest.json` on GitHub:**
    *   Go to your `manifest.json` file in the repository.
    *   Click "Edit".
    *   Replace its entire content with the second code block above.
    *   Commit this change directly to your `main` (or default) branch.

3.  **Re-trigger the GitHub Actions Workflow for `v1.0.0`:**
    *   Since the `v1.0.0` tag already exists and the workflow likely failed or didn't run correctly with the previous invalid `package.json`:
        *   **Delete the `v1.0.0` GitHub Release:** Go to the "Releases" page of your repository and delete the `v1.0.0` release. This is important because the workflow will try to create it.
        *   **Delete the `v1.0.0` Tag from GitHub:**
            *   If you have Git installed locally (even if you don't build with it), the easiest way is:
                ```bash
                git pull # To make sure your local repo knows about remote changes
                git push --delete origin v1.0.0
                ```
            *   If you don't use Git locally, deleting tags via the GitHub UI can be a bit hidden. Sometimes it's easier to delete and re-create the release, ensuring the tag is also handled.
        *   **Delete the `v1.0.0` Tag Locally (if it exists and you use Git locally):**
            ```bash
            git tag -d v1.0.0
            ```        *   **Re-create and Push the Tag:**
            *   Make sure your local `main` branch is up-to-date with the committed changes to `package.json` and `manifest.json`.
            *   Then, re-tag the correct commit:
                ```bash
                # Ensure you are on the commit that has the updated json files
                git tag v1.0.0
                git push origin v1.0.0
                ```
            *   If you're not using Git locally for tagging, after committing the JSON file changes via the web UI, you might need to draft a *new* release on GitHub, specify `v1.0.0` as the tag, and ensure it's targeting your `main` branch. This act of creating the release *with that tag* should trigger the workflow.

Once these files are correct in your `main` branch, and the `v1.0.0` tag is pushed *anew*, the GitHub Action should trigger, successfully read the valid `package.json`, install dependencies, build your plugin, create the GitHub Release for `v1.0.0`, and upload the correct `main.js` and `manifest.json` (with version `1.0.0` inside) as assets.

I appreciate your directness. Let's get this working.
